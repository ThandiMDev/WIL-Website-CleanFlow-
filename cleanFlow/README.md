Vibe — Mood & Purpose-Based Venue Discovery

Find your space, not just a place. Vibe helps you discover cafes, coworking spaces, and study spots based on how you want to feel or what you need to do — Quiet, Social, Focus, Creative, Cheap Wifi — instead of forcing you to search by category or keyword. 

1. Purpose

Existing "vibe-based" discovery apps (Vibemap, VibeCheck, Inside Vibe) focus almost entirely on nightlife and social occasions. There's a clear gap for everyday, purpose-driven discovery — finding a quiet café to work from, a spot with reliable wifi, or somewhere social to meet friends. Vibe fills that gap by making mood/purpose the primary way you search, not an afterthought.

This repository contains the Android client (Kotlin, XML layouts) built against a custom REST API.

2. Key features

Feature	Description
Mood-based search: The home screen leads with mood chips (Quiet, Social, Focus, Creative, Cheap Wifi) instead of a category list or keyword search bar.

"Why this matches":	Every venue detail screen shows which tags contributed to the match and how many users confirmed each one — the recommendation is never a black box.

Pluggable venue data layer:	Venue search is wrapped behind an IVenueDataProvider interface on the API side, so the underlying data source (currently BizData, an OpenStreetMap-based API) can be swapped for a paid provider like Geoapify or Google Places later without touching the rest of the system.

Secure authentication: Passwords are hashed server-side with ASP.NET Core Identity (PBKDF2) — never stored or transmitted in plain text. Sessions use JWT bearer tokens, stored on-device via EncryptedSharedPreferences.

Multi-language support:	English, isiZulu, and Afrikaans — covering UI strings, mood tag names, and settings labels.
Push notifications	Firebase Cloud Messaging alerts users when a new venue matching their saved mood appears nearby.

3. Screens

Login / Register — email + password auth, Google SSO (stretch)
